# Titanic-Survival-Project


## Predicting the Survival of Titanic Passengers

1. Understand the dataset
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Exploration
4. Feature Engineering
5. Data Preprocessing for Model
6. Basic Model Building
7. Model Tuning
8. Ensemble Modle BuildingÂ¶
9. Results



## Project Planning 

1. Understand nature of the data  .info() .describe()
2. Histograms and Boxplots: for understanding trends
3. Values counts: Check Category
4. Missing data: How to remove missing data or impute missing data
5. Correlation between metrix: correlate the columns
6. Exploring intreseting themes
    1. Wealthy survive?
    2. By location
    3. Age scatterplot with ticket price
    4. Young and wealthy variable?
    5. Total spent?
7. Feature Engineering: create new varibles
8. Preprocess data together or use a transformer? [this will used in the model]
    1. Use label for train and test
9. scaling?
10. Model Baseline
11. Model comparision with csv


## Light data exploration

1. For Numeric Data 
    1. Made histograms to understand distributions
    2. Corrplot
    3. Pivot table comparing survival rate across numeric variables
2. For Categorical Data 
    1. Made bar charts to understand balance of claases 
    2. Made pivot tables to understand relationship with survial
